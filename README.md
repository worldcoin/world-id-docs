# World ID

## <img align="left" width="28" height="28" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/worldcoin/world-id-docs/main/public/images/shared-readme/readme-world-id.png" alt="" style="margin-right: 0; padding-right: 4px;" /> About World ID

World ID is the privacy-first identity protocol that brings global proof of personhood to the internet. More on World ID in the [announcement blog post](https://world.org/blog/announcements/introducing-world-id-and-sdk).

World ID lets you seamlessly integrate authentication into your app that verifies accounts belong to real persons through [Sign in with World ID](https://docs.world.org/world-id/reference/sign-in). For additional flexibility and cases where you need extreme privacy, [Incognito Actions](https://docs.world.org/world-id/id/cloud) lets you verify users in a way that cannot be tracked across verifications.

Follow the [Quick Start](https://docs.world.org/world-id/) guide for the easiest way to get started.

## Mini Apps

Mini apps enable third-party developers to create native-like applications within World App. We currently support World ID, Payments, and Sign in with Ethereum. Building a mini app will provide access to our rapidly growing user network and monetization opportunities via WLD and USDC.

### How it Works

Mini Apps work by sending [Commands](http://docs.world.org/mini-apps/quick-start/commands) via the MiniKit SDK to World App, and listening for [Responses](http://docs.world.org/mini-apps/quick-start/responses) passed back.

To make it easy to build mini apps, we have released the [MiniKit-JS SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@worldcoin/minikit-js).

## World Chain

World Chain is a blockchain for humans. World chain offers several unique primitives:

-   Free gas fees for all verified humans
-   Native mobile distribution to all World App users through mini-apps
-   Simplified crypto transactions through mini apps
-   Sybil resistance for developers via World ID
-   Airdrop of WLD tokens to all verified humans

These primitives enable World Chain builders to build never before possible applications and reach a global audience.

World Chain is built on the [Superchain](https://docs.optimism.io/stack/interop/explainer).
