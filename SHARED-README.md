World ID is the privacy-first identity protocol that brings global proof of personhood to the internet. More on World ID in the [announcement blog post](https://worldcoin.org/blog/announcements/introducing-world-id-and-sdk).

World ID lets you seamlessly integrate authentication into your app that verifies accounts belong to real persons through [Sign in with Worldcoin](https://docs.worldcoin.org/id/sign-in). For additional flexibility and cases where you need extreme privacy, [Anonymous Actions](https://docs.worldcoin.org/id/anonymous-actions) lets you verify users in a way that cannot be tracked across verifications.

## 📄 Documentation
