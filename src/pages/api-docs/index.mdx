# API Introduction

The Worldcoin Developer Portal offers an API to enable easy verification of World IDs and relevant credentials.

## Base URL

```
https://developer.worldcoin.org
```

## Authentication

The main proof verification endpoints require no authentication and are only rate limited (see `/precheck/{app_id}` and `/verify/{app_id}` endpoints for details).

Other endpoints do require authentication and there is two mechanisms available.

- Login token. Intended only for using the frontend of the Developer Portal. These tokens are short-lived and require personal interaction through Sign in with Worldcoin.
- API keys.

### API Keys

- API keys are intended for use by third-party applications and for server-to-server communication. They are long-lived and can be revoked at any time.
- API keys are scoped to a team and have full permissions for any actions as any user of the Developer Portal.
- Once you have an API key, use it as the value of the `Authorization` header in your requests. For example:

```
Authorization: Bearer <API_KEY>
```
