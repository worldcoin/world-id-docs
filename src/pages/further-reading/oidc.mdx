# OIDC Explainer

The following diagram outlines the general authentication flow for an integrating app:

## Registration

Before OIDC authentication can take place, developers must register their applications with Worldcoin. This is a one-time action. There are two ways to accomplish this:

1. Create a new application on the [Developer Portal](https://developer.worldcoin.org).
2. Use the `/register` endpoint, request body details can be [found here](/reference/sign-in#register-app).

During registration, you will need to provide the following values:

-   `redirect_uris`: **Required**, list of approved websites the user can be redirected to after successful authentication.
-   `client_name`: **Optional**, the name of the application that's displayed to users
-   `application_type`: **Optional**, one of "web" or "mobile". Defaults to "web"
-   `grant_types`: **Optional**, the type of flows this application will use. Can include "authorization_code", "implicit", or "hybrid". Defaults to "authorization_code"
-   `response_type`: **Optional**, the response type expected by the application. Can include any of "code", "token", or "id_token". Defaults to "code"
    -   `code`: **Recommended for most applications.** The [`/authorize`](#authentication) endpoint will include an authorization code that can be exchanged for an access token and/or ID token on the [`/token`](/api/sign-in-reference#exchange-code) endpoint. Best suited for web/mobile applications with dedicated backends, where security is the highest priority.
    -   `token`: The [`/authorize`](#authentication) endpoint will include an access token, which can be used to fetch user information from the [`/userinfo`](/api/sign-in-reference#get-user-info) and [`/introspect`](/api/sign-in-reference#introspect) endpoints. Best suited for low-risk applications, and client-only/SPAs where a `client_secret` cannot be concealed.
    -   `id_token`: The [`/authorize`](#authentication) endpoint will include a signed JWT containing information about the user, including the unique `sub` claim (otherwise known as the [nullifier hash](/idkit/reference#response)). Provides simple user authentication, while keeping the amount of user data shared to a minimum. Best for privacy-conscious apps.

<Note>
	All redirect URIs must be over HTTPS, and contain no port numbers or URL fragments. For example, `https://app.example.com/login` is valid, but `https://app.example.com:3000/login` is not. Similarly, `https://app.example.com/login#foo` is not valid, but `https://app.example.com/login?foo=bar` is.
</Note>

After registration is complete, you will have a valid `app_id` that will be needed for every other step in the authentication process. This value is equivalent to `client_id` from the [OIDC specification](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#AuthRequest)

## Flows

World ID supports the [authorization code](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#CodeFlowAuth), [implicit](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#ImplicitFlowAuth), and [hybrid](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-core-1_0.html#HybridFlowAuth) flows from the OIDC spec. Applications can use any one of these flows to authenticate users.

_Generally_, applications should implement the authorization code flow, as it is more secure than the implicit flow. Applications without backend servers (that may be running purely client-side) are more suited to implicit authentication.

## Authentication

Authentication begins with a request to the `/authorize` endpoint.

When using the native Sign In with Worldcoin page, most of the OIDC process is handled for you. You can begin the authentication cycle by redirecting your users to:

```
https://id.worldcoin.org/authorize?client_id={app_id}&response_type={code|token|id_token}&redirect_uri={encoded_redirect_url}&scope={scope}&state={state_value}&nonce={nonce_value}
```

Example values could be:

{/* cSpell:disable */}

-   `client_id`: obtained from the Developer Portal or `/register` endpoint (example: `app_lshSNnaJfdt6Sohu6YAA`).
-   `response_type`: response type as specified in OIDC spec, remember to URL encode (example: `code%20id_token`).
-   `redirect_uri`: where the user is redirected upon successful authentication. Must be on the approved redirect URI list which can always be updated in the Developer Portal (example: `https%3A%2F%2Fapp.example.com%2Flogin`).
-	`scope`: space-separated list of scopes to request. Defaults to `openid` if not provided. (example: `openid%20profile%20email`).
-   `state`: unique value used to track a user's session (example: `session_102030405060708090`).
-   `nonce`: random value to prevent replay attacks (example: `z-dkEmoy_ujfk7B8uTiQpp`). Required when using the `id_token` response type.

{/* cSpell:enable */}

The user will then authenticate with their World ID via the World app. Once successfully authorized, the user is redirected back to your application. The redirect URL will contain a number of values, depending on the flow you are using.

### Redirect Responses

If using the default authorization code flow, the redirect URL will contain the following params:

-   `code`: An authorization code that can be exchanged for an ID token
-   `state`: The optional state value passed to the `/authorize` endpoint

If you received a response containing an _authorization code_, you must exchange it for an ID token on the `/token` endpoint. Request details can be [seen here](/reference/sign-in#exchange-code).

If using implicit flow, the redirect URL will contain the following params:

-   `id_token`: A signed JWT identifying the user, and any requested scope information

<Note type="warning">ID tokens must always be verified, and should not be blindly accepted! Additionally, you must validate that the `nonce` within the ID token matches the nonce you provided.</Note>

To verify an ID token, fetch the public key from the `/jwks` endpoint. You can read more about this process at the [Auth0 blog](https://auth0.com/blog/navigating-rs256-and-jwks/) or [JWT.io](https://jwt.io/), but one example method could be:

```ts
import * as jose from 'jose'

const verifyJwt = (token: string) => {
	const JWKS = jose.createRemoteJWKSet(new URL('https://id.worldcoin.org/jwks.json'))

	const { payload, header } = await jose.jwtVerify(token, JWKS, {
		issuer: 'https://id.worldcoin.org',
		aud: 'app_lshSNnaJfdt6Sohu6YAA',
	})

	return payload
}

verifyJwt('eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6Ikp.eyAs.XVCJ9...')
```
