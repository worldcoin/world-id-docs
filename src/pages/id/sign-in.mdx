# Sign in with World ID

<Note type="warning">
	When using Sign in with World ID, we highly recommend allowing users to set a separate recovery method for their account
	(e.g. email), in case users lose access to or reset their World ID. Read about World ID Reset [here](/further-reading/world-id-reset).
</Note>

World ID can be used as an authentication mechanism. Some helpful resources for integrating World ID with your app:

-   World ID [Auth0 Integration](https://worldcoin.org/auth0).
-   [NextAuth.js Template Repository](https://github.com/worldcoin/world-id-nextauth-template).

<Note>
	Typical OIDC-compatible authentication engines include [Auth0](https://auth0.com/), [AWS
	Cognito](https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/), [CloudFlare
	Access](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/zero-trust/access/), [OneLogin](https://www.onelogin.com/) and many
	more. Most languages and frameworks have simple open source packages for this.

    <TabItem label="Auth0 Integration">
        Follow the [Auth0 Integration](https://worldcoin.org/auth0) installation instructions to add Sign in with World ID to your Auth0 Tenant using the Client ID and Client Secret found in the [Developer Portal](https://developer.worldcoin.org).
        <Note>
            If your app hasn't yet integrated Auth0, you can use any of their [various SDK libraries](https://auth0.com/docs/libraries) to get started. This allows using Sign in with World ID on a very broad range of platforms, including web, mobile, and desktop apps.

        1. Create a new repository from our [World ID NextAuth Template Repository](https://github.com/worldcoin/world-id-nextauth-template).
        2. Rename `.env.example` to `.env.local`, and add your Client ID and Client Secret to the `.env.local` file in your new repository. You can find these in the [Developer Portal](https://developer.worldcoin.org).
        3. Add the app's URL to the list of allowed redirect URIs in the [Developer Portal](https://developer.worldcoin.org). For example, if your app is hosted at `https://example.com`, add `https://example.com/api/auth/callback/worldcoin` to the list of allowed redirect URIs.
        <Note>
            You must use a Staging App to use `localhost` as part of a redirect URI. For this example, you'd use `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/worldcoin` as the redirect URI.
        </Note>
        4. Run `pnpm i && pnpm dev` to install dependencies and run the app locally, or deploy the app to [Vercel](https://vercel.com).

    <TabItem label="Custom Authentication Engines">
      <Note type="warning">
        If you don't have an authentication engine, you can implement OIDC flows yourself. See the [OIDC Explainer](/further-reading/oidc) and [Sign In Reference](/reference/sign-in) for details.
      </Note>

      Configure your OIDC authentication engine to use World ID as an Identity Provider (IdP), you will need the following information:

      - **Discovery endpoint**: `https://id.worldcoin.org/.well-known/openid-configuration` (if supported by your OIDC client engine, this will set everything automatically, continue below otherwise)

      ### Required inputs

      - **Client ID**: your app id from the Developer Portal (e.g. {/* cSpell:disable */}`app_GBkZ1KlVUdFTjeMXskrX`{/* cSpell:enable */}).
      - **Client secret**: app secret, obtained from the "Sign In" tab in the Developer Portal (e.g. `sk_6f07e1566ee4b765fe23d8c8`).
      - **Authorize endpoint**: `https://id.worldcoin.org/authorize`
      - **Scope**: must contain `openid`, and may contain two optional scopes for compatibility with applications that require them:
        - `profile` to receive dummy name information about the user
        - `email` to receive dummy email information about the user
      - **Response type**: depends on how you want to authenticate, follow the recommendations of your engine. We recommend authorization code flow for server-side apps and implicit flow for client-side apps.
        - `code` for authorization code flow
        - `id_token` (recommended) for implicit flow (ensure your authentication engine provides and validates a `nonce` when using the implicit flow)
        - `id_token token` or `code token` for hybrid flow. Generally not recommended for Sign in with World ID.

      <Note>
        We use the same JWT token as the `id_token` and `access_token`. There are no actions or information accessible with the `access_token` that are not contained within the `id_token`, as Sign in with World ID is intended only for authentication and not authorization.

        We do not recommend using the hybrid OIDC flow for this reason.
      </Note>

      ### Optional inputs

      - **(Not required for implicit flow). Token endpoint**: `https://id.worldcoin.org/token`
      - **(Only used for hybrid flow). User info endpoint**: `https://id.worldcoin.org/userinfo`
      - **(Only used for hybrid flow). Introspect endpoint**: `https://id.worldcoin.org/introspect`

      Once you have configured this, you can start the authentication flow from your app or authentication engine.

## Mapping User Info

<Note>The `https://id.worldcoin.org/beta` claim has been deprecated and replaced by `https://id.worldcoin.org/v1`.</Note>

The `/userinfo` endpoint or `id_token` JWT returns a JSON object with the following fields:

```json {{ title: "Response" }}
{
	"sub": "0x2ae86d6d747702b3b2c81811cd2b39875e8fa6b780ee4a207bdc203a7860b535",
	"https://id.worldcoin.org/beta": { // deprecated, will be removed in the future
		"likely_human": "strong",
		"credential_type": "orb"
	},
  "https://id.worldcoin.org/v1": {
    "verification_level": "orb", // "orb" or "device"
  },
  // if `email` scope is included:
	"email": "0x2ae86d6d747702b3b2c81811cd2b39875e8fa6b780ee4a207bdc203a7860b535@id.worldcoin.org", 
  // if `profile` scope is included:
	"name": "World ID User",
	"given_name": "World ID",
	"family_name": "User"
}
```

<Note type="warning">
	The `email` field is set only for compatibility with apps that cannot function without it. Users cannot receive
	emails at this address, and it should be ignored when possible.
</Note>

The `sub` field is the user's nullifier hash -- their unique identifier in the context of your app. A user's nullifier hash will be different for each app they use.

You can information about a user's World ID Credentials in the `https://id.worldcoin.org/v1` object. Use the `verification_level` field to determine whether the user has been Orb-verified or not.
