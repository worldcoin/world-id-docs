# World ID Lite

World ID Lite is replacing the previous `phone` credential in World ID. World ID Lite relies on the user's identity wallet, such as World App, to verify a user's unique device.

The premise of World ID Lite is users having a unique mobile device. This is more scalable, user friendly, and privacy-preserving than the previous `phone` credential, which was issued when a user verified their phone number in World App.

## When to use World ID Lite vs. World ID Orb Credential

World ID Lite offers a credential that's convenient for a user to receive, but it also provides a weaker level of resistance to Sybil attacks than World ID's Orb credential. It's best used for applications that only require a moderate level of sybil resistance or have a significant userbase in regions where the Orb is not available.

For example, a gaming application that wants to prevent many bot accounts from being created would be a great use case for World ID Lite. However, an undercollateralized lending application would likely want to use World ID's Orb credential, as it provides the highest level of sybil resistance.

## Benefits

World ID Lite has a number of benefits over the previous `phone` credential:

- **Automatic Issuance:** World ID Lite is automatically issued to all World App users with a unique device. No action needs to be taken by users to receive this credential other than downloading World App.
- **Privacy:** Users can now receive a World ID without providing any information at all. Although verifying a phone number in World App has always been optional, users could previously only use World ID after they verified their phone number or verified at an Orb.
- **Strength:** World ID Lite is more resistant to Sybil attacks, as the cost and complexity of acquiring a separate unique mobile device is higher than acquiring a separate phone number.
