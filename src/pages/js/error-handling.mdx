# Error Handling

Errors in the JS package will generally be returned in the Promise rejection of the [`.init()`](/js/reference#init) method. In exceptional cases, some errors may be thrown in the Javascript console (though this is mostly for unhandled errors, and is not normal behavior).

The `errorResult` object that is returned in the Promise rejection has the following structure:

```json
{
  "code": "already_signed",
  "detail": "User has previously signed and submitted proof for this action."
}
```

<Callout title="Tip">
  When debugging, we always recommend you also check the Javascript console for
  any additional details.
</Callout>

<Callout title="Note">
  If you enabled telemetry, any errors will be reported to help us proactively
  detect and fix any bugs. If you are running into an issue and don't have
  telemetry enabled, we recommend enabling it so the error can be reported.
</Callout>

## Error codes

The JS package may return any of the following error codes.

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Code</th>
      <th>Description</th>
      <th>How to fix?</th>
    </tr>
