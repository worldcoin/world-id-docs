# Share

Share will be the primary way to access the browsers native share drawer. 
This command will let you prompt users to share content, files, and links with other users through
any of the communication apps installed on their device. This command will also support downloading media to their device from your mini app. 

This command will be available from MiniKit 2.0.0 and World App 2.8.84 onwards.

## Creating the payload

{/* This command is an abstraction on top of the web [Navigator.share](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/share) API. */}

```tsx {{ title: 'app/page.tsx' }}

export type SharePayload = {
  files: File[];
  title?: string;
  text?: string;
  url?: string;
};
```

## Using the command

There's no response from this command.

```tsx {{ title: 'app/page.tsx' }}
import { MiniKit } from '@worldcoin/minikit-js'

const shareCommand = async () => {
	await MiniKit.commandsAsync.share({
		title: 'Invite Link', // Preview used in share drawer
		text: 'Use this invite code to join my mini app', // Text sent in shared message
		url: 'https://worldcoin.org', // URL to share
	})
}


const ImportantPage = () => {
	const handleClick = () => {
		// ...
		await shareCommand()
	}
	return <button onClick={handleClick}>Invite Friends</button>
}

```
### Example in World App
Here's what the share drawer looks like in World App.

    <div className='grid justify-items-center text-center'>
        <video className="m-auto" width="300" autoPlay muted loop playsInline>
            <source src="/images/docs/mini-apps/commands/share.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
    		Your browser does not support the video tag.
    	</video>
    </div>
