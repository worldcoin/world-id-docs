# Guidelines

These guidelines are meant to help you succeed as a mini app developer. Please follow them to ensure your app is approved.

## MiniKit Integration

Integrate MiniKit to supercharge your web app with exclusive features like World ID and Wallet access, making your mini app more engaging and valuable to users.

To get your mini app approved, it's essential to use the MiniKit SDK commands effectively to enhance the user experience.
We're looking for meaningful integrations, whether through _World ID_ and _Wallet access_ , or other creative uses that add real value.

## Mobile First

Mini apps are inherently accessed via mobile, so your application UI should look and feel like a mobile app.

### Key considerations for a mobile-first experience:

-   Use tab navigation to simplify movement within the app.
-   Implement snap-to text boxes for easy user input.
-   Avoid footers, sidebars, and excessive scrolling.
-   Provide clear and direct navigation without hamburger menus.
-   Ensure smooth transitions between different screens or sections.
-   Use consistent background colors for a cohesive visual experience.
-   Provide clear navigation cues to help users understand where they are and how to proceed.
-   Ensure all UI elements are responsive and adapt well to different screen sizes.
-   Use fonts that are optimized for readability on mobile devices.
-   Include a splash page for sign-in if needed.

			Your browser does not support the video tag.

		❌ Bad Example <br /> Footer and long scrolling

			Your browser does not support the video tag.

		✅ Good Example <br /> Bottom tab navigation and anchored buttons

## Scroll Bounce on IOS.

We recommend you avoid scroll bounce error on iOS devices. Try disabling autoscroll & maybe fixed position elements or using 100dvh instead of 100vh.

If you are not using a bottom navigation bar, you can use the following CSS to disable the scroll bounce error:

```css
html,
body {
	width: 100vw;
	height: 100vh;
	overscroll-behavior: none;
	overflow: hidden;
}
```

Alternatively, you can try this approach which allows scrolling while still preventing the bounce effect:

```css
html,
body {
	-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch;
	overscroll-behavior: none;
	overflow: scroll;
}
```

## App Icon

Your app icon should be a **square** image with a non white background.

## Load times

For mini apps, 2-3 seconds max for initial load and under 1 second for subsequent actions should be your target.
However, always test for real-world scenarios and provide visual feedback during loading to maintain user trust.

## Branding & Identity

Do not use the term "official" in your app name, description, or interface. Mini apps are third-party applications and should not create the impression that they are officially endorsed by or affiliated with World.

Additionally, do not use the World logo or any modified version of it in your app. This includes using the World logo as part of your app icon or within your app's interface.

Mini apps should maintain their own distinct brand identity while integrating with the World ecosystem. This helps users clearly understand which applications are developed by World and which are created by third-party developers.

## Chance based

We recommend developers to avoid building chance based games, as these games have a very low likelihood of being approved.

**Chance based** = prize awarded based on chance, not skill. This means you are using a RNG to determine a winner.
You can still have prizes but they need to be awarded based on skill. Not randomness. So winning a game where I get a prize is skill based.

## NFTs on iOS

Mini Apps may allow users to view their own NFTs, provided that NFT ownership does not unlock features or functionality within the app.
Mini Apps may allow users to browse NFT collections owned by others, provided that the mini apps may not include buttons, external links, or other calls to action that direct customers to purchasing mechanisms other than in-app purchase.

## Localization

Many of our users are located around the world. Apps that are localised for each region will perform significantly better.
You can recognize the user's locale by using the <Link href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept-Language">Accept-Language</Link> header

For next.js apps, you can use [Next.js Internationalization](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/internationalization) to localize your app.

These languages are particularly important given our users:

1. English
2. Spanish
3. Thai
4. Japanese
5. Korean
6. Portuguese

## Usernames

You should never display the user's wallet address, always use their username.
If you use Sign in with World ID you should not be doing any transactions with the user's wallet address, instead you should be using the username.
Sign in with World ID and Verify offer the same World ID guarantees, but Verify is more reliable.

## Using the Address Book

World ID inherently allows anonymity between applications. We generally encourage
developers to use their own Verify Command and verify the proof. However, we also offer a World ID
address book. This contract stores a mapping `addressVerifiedUntil` you can query to see if a World App
address is World ID Orb verified.

## Design Patterns

Here are some design patterns that we recommend you follow:

1. When a user is authenticated through their wallet, always show their username instead of the wallet address
2. Use the "Verify" command to confirm important actions or identity verification.
3. When dealing with wallet addresses, use an address book to link them to recognizable usernames or other identifiers

If your inspiration is still off, here are some concepts that you can follow to build your mini app. Always keep in mind adding value to users through the minikit commands.

-   **Limited Edition Art Distribution**: Build an app that allows artists to distribute limited editions of their work, ensuring that each human can claim only a certain number of pieces.
-   **Sybil-Resistant Airdrop Platform**: Build a platform for distributing tokens to verified humans, ensuring that airdrops reach genuine users.
-   **Community Engagement Airdrops**: Create an app that rewards users for participating in community activities, verified through proof of personhood.
-   **Bot-Free Social Network**: Build a social platform that integrates World ID to limit bot activity, enhancing content quality and user engagement.
-   **Human-AI Interaction Platform**: Develop an app where AI agents can interact with verified humans for tasks like customer support or data collection.
-   **Decentralized Credit Marketplace**: Build a platform that connects borrowers and lenders, using proof of personhood and zero-knowledge attributes to assess creditworthiness.
-   **Merchant Payment Solutions**: Develop a platform for local businesses to accept payments in cryptocurrencies, leveraging the World ecosystem for seamless transactions.
