# Data & Analytics

Track only what answers **critical product questions**â€”nothing more.  
This page shows you **what to measure, why, and how to start in one sprint**.

## 1 Â· Mental Model _Q â†’ M â†’ E_

> **Question â†’ Metric â†’ Event**

1. **Question** you want answered
2. **Metric** that quantifies it
3. **Event** (or two) that feed that metric

| Product Question             | Metric (M)                    | Minimal Events (E)               |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Do users see value on day 0? | **Conversion to First Value** | `signup`, `first_value`          |
| Do they come back?           | **D1 / D7 Retention**         | `app_open`                       |
| Will growth be organic?      | **Invite Acceptance Rate**    | `invite_sent`, `invite_accepted` |
| Can we reâ€‘engage them?       | **Push Open Rate**            | `notification_open`              |

If an event doesn't roll up to a key question, skip it.

## 2 Â· Core Event Set (6 Lines of Code)

```ts
track('app_open') // every launch
track('signup', { method: 'id' })
track('first_value', { action: 'ðŸŽ‰' })
track('invite_sent')
track('invite_accepted')
track('notification_open')
```

That is enough to build funnels, retention, and viral metrics.

## 3 Â· Action Plan

**Focus on these 4 metrics weekly until they're all green:**

-   **Signup â†’ First Value %** (target: â‰¥40%) - Are users getting value immediately?
-   **D1 Retention** (target: â‰¥25%) - Are they coming back the next day?
-   **Invite Acceptance %** (target: â‰¥15%) - Is word-of-mouth working?
-   **Push Open %** (target: â‰¥15%) - Can we re-engage users?

**Next steps:** Pick the lowest metric and spend 1-2 sprints fixing it. Don't touch anything else until all four are hitting targets.

## 4 Â· Common Pitfalls to Dodge

-   **Event sprawl** â€“ >10 events = analysis paralysis.
-   **Vanity charts** â€“ page views â‰  value.
-   **No cohorts** â€“ averages hide churn.
-   **Premature segmentation** â€“ wait for 1k users.
-   **Ignoring retention** â€“ acquisition is useless without it.

Analytics should light the path, not become the journey. Keep it lean, learn fast, and build what moves the needle.
