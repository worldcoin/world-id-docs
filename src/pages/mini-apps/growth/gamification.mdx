# Gamification (Low-Code Mechanics)

**Goal**: Increase user retention and engagement through carefully designed game mechanics that create habit loops.

Gamification isn't about turning your app into a game—it's about using proven psychological principles to make routine actions more engaging and rewarding.

## Why It Works

Game mechanics tap into fundamental human psychology: our need for achievement, progress, and social comparison. Duolingo saw retention jump from 12% D1 to 55% after implementing streak mechanics. The key is choosing mechanics that align with your core user behavior, not just adding badges everywhere.

## Core Mechanics by Impact & Effort

| Mechanic            | Effort | Why It Works                                            | Quick Implementation                                         |
| ------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Daily Streaks**   | ★★☆☆☆  | Creates habit formation; users hate breaking chains     | Track daily actions, show streak count, celebrate milestones |
| **Progress Bars**   | ★☆☆☆☆  | Visual momentum; users hate seeing 80% incomplete       | CSS progress indicators for any goal completion              |
| **Badges & Levels** | ★★☆☆☆  | Collectibles trigger completion bias                    | Emoji icons + achievement unlocks                            |
| **Leaderboards**    | ★★☆☆☆  | Social comparison drives engagement                     | Simple top 10 list, refresh weekly                           |
| **Mystery Rewards** | ★★☆☆☆  | Variable rewards release dopamine (slot machine effect) | Daily random reward from small pool                          |

## Strategic Implementation

### 1. Daily Streaks (Start Here)

**Why this first**: Highest retention impact with moderate effort. Creates powerful daily habit loops.

**Core concept**: Track consecutive days of user activity, celebrate milestones, make breaking streaks feel costly.

**Implementation strategy**:

-   Store `currentStreak`, `longestStreak`, `lastActiveDate` per user
-   Check daily: consecutive day = +1, gap = reset to 1
-   Celebrate at days 3, 7, 14, 30 with visual rewards
-   Show streak prominently in app header

```typescript
// Simple streak logic
const updateStreak = (lastActive: string) => {
	const daysSinceLastActive = getDaysDifference(lastActive, today)
	return daysSinceLastActive === 1 ? streak + 1 : 1
}
```

**World App integration**: Use notification badges to show current streak count on home screen.

### 2. Progress Bars & Visual Momentum

**Psychology**: Users hate leaving things 80% complete. Visual progress creates urgency to finish.

**Where to use**:

-   Profile completion ("2/5 steps remaining")
-   Daily/weekly goals ("7/10 tasks done")
-   Social milestones ("3/5 friends invited")
-   Skill progression ("Level 4: 80% to Level 5")

**Key principle**: Always show progress toward the next achievable milestone, not distant end goals.

### 3. Achievement Badges

**Strategy**: Create collectible moments that trigger completion bias and provide social proof.

**Badge categories that work**:

-   **Onboarding**: "First Steps" (welcome badge), "Explorer" (tried 3 features)
-   **Social**: "Social Butterfly" (first share), "Connector" (5 friends invited)
-   **Engagement**: "Week Warrior" (7-day streak), "Power User" (daily active for 30 days)
-   **Milestones**: "High Achiever" (reached level 10), "Completionist" (100% profile)

**Design tips**:

-   Use emoji icons (🦋, ⚔️, 🏆) for zero design cost
-   Make early badges easy to get (within first session)
-   Create clear progression: Common → Rare → Epic
-   Show badge collection in user profile for social proof

### 4. Social Leaderboards

**When to use**: Best for apps with clear scoring metrics (points, levels, achievements completed).

**Types that work**:

-   **Weekly leaderboards**: Reset regularly so everyone has a chance
-   **Friend leaderboards**: Compare with people you know (higher engagement)
-   **Category leaderboards**: "Top Streaks", "Most Social", "Fastest Completion"

**Key strategies**:

-   Keep it simple: Top 10 list with current user highlighted
-   Use emoji rankings (🥇🥈🥉) for positions 1-3
-   Refresh weekly to prevent permanent dominance
-   Only show verified users to prevent gaming

**World App advantage**: World ID ensures fair competition with one-person-one-account guarantee.

### 5. Variable Reward Systems

**Psychology**: Variable rewards trigger dopamine more than predictable ones (slot machine effect).

**Implementation ideas**:

-   **Daily mystery box**: Random reward from a small pool (coins, badges, features)
-   **Streak bonuses**: Random multiplier for milestone completions
-   **Surprise rewards**: Occasional "lucky day" bonuses for regular actions
-   **Loot boxes**: Earned through achievements, contain random useful items

**Reward pool strategy**:

-   70% common rewards (small coin amounts, basic items)
-   25% rare rewards (larger bonuses, temporary premium features)
-   5% epic rewards (exclusive badges, significant bonuses)

**Key principle**: Make the anticipation of opening more exciting than the reward itself.

## Design Principles

### 1. One Core Loop

Pick one primary habit loop and nail it before adding more.
**Example flow**: Daily check-in → earn streak → unlock reward → share achievement → invite friends

### 2. Early Wins

Users should earn their first badge/reward within 30 seconds of first use. This creates immediate positive reinforcement and sets expectations for future rewards.

### 3. Surface Progress Everywhere

-   Show current streak in app header/navigation
-   Display progress bars for any incomplete goals
-   Badge count in user profile for social proof
-   Preview next achievable reward/milestone

### 4. Measure & Optimize

Track key events: `streak_extended`, `badge_earned`, `leaderboard_viewed`, `reward_claimed`

**Golden rule**: If a mechanic doesn't improve D7 retention after 2 weeks, remove it.

## World App Integration

**Notification badges**: Use `MiniKit.setBadgeCount()` to show current streak on home screen icon—powerful visibility boost.

**Fair competition**: Leverage World ID verification (`MiniKit.user.worldIdVerified`) to ensure only real humans compete on leaderboards.

**Share achievements**: Integrate with share command to let users broadcast major accomplishments to friends.

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Over-gamification**: Don't add badges for every tiny action—dilutes achievement value
2. **Participation trophies**: Make early badges easy but later ones meaningful
3. **Pay-to-win mechanics**: Keep purchases separate from core progression
4. **Feature creep**: Start with one mechanic, prove it works, then expand

## Your Next Steps

1. **Start simple**: Implement daily streaks first—highest impact for effort invested
2. **Add visual progress**: One progress bar or completion indicator
3. **Create 3-5 early badges**: Tied directly to your core user actions
4. **Measure ruthlessly**: Track D7 retention before/after each mechanic
5. **Expand gradually**: Only add new mechanics after current ones prove effective

The goal isn't to build a game —it's to make your core experience more engaging and habit-forming.
