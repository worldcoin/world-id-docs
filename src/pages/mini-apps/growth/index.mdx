# Overview

A focused, step-by-step guide to growing your mini app within the World ecosystem. Everything is scoped to what an indie hacker or small team can realistically ship in a few weeks.

## Overview & Philosophy

Building a successful mini app requires more than great featuresâ€”you need users to discover, engage with, and stick around. This growth playbook focuses on four key areas that drive sustainable growth:

1. **[Invites & Viral Loops](/mini-apps/growth/invites-viral)** - Turn your users into advocates
2. **[Gamification](/mini-apps/growth/gamification)** - Build engagement through game mechanics
3. **[Retention via Notifications](/mini-apps/growth/notifications)** - Keep users coming back
4. **[Data & Analytics](/mini-apps/growth/analytics)** - Measure what matters

## Real-World Results

The strategies in this playbook are based on proven case studies:

-   **PayPal's referral program**: 7-10% daily growth
-   **Dropbox's two-sided rewards**: 3900% growth in 15 months
-   **Duolingo's streak mechanics**: Retention jumped from 12% to 55%
