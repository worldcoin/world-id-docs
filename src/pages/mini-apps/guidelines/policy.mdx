# App Review Guidelines

World App seeks to foster a diverse and flourishing ecosystem of applications while at the same time ensuring users stay safe, and privacy is maximized. These applications are displayed to users within World App, but users interact with these applications either within a web browser or as a platform native application. World App has sole discretion of determining how apps are presented to users within its platform.

These guidelines dictate the rules for apps which seek to be displayed to users from within World App.

## MiniKit Integration

Integrate MiniKit to supercharge your web app with exclusive features like World ID and Wallet access, making your mini app more engaging and valuable to users.

To get your mini app approved, it's essential to use the MiniKit SDK commands effectively to enhance the user experience.
We're looking for meaningful integrations, whether through _World ID_ and _Wallet access_ , or other creative uses that add real value.

## Safety

The following content is not permitted for apps:

-   **Objectionable Content:**
    -   Defamatory, discriminatory, or mean-spirited content, including references or commentary about religion, race, sexual orientation, gender, national/ethnic origin, or other targeted groups
    -   Realistic portrayals of people or animals being killed, maimed, tortured, or abused, or content that encourages violence.
    -   Depictions that encourage illegal or reckless use of weapons and dangerous objects, or facilitate the purchase of firearms or ammunition.
    -   Overtly sexual or pornographic material, defined as "explicit descriptions or displays of sexual organs or activities intended to stimulate erotic rather than aesthetic or emotional feelings."
    -   NSFW (Not Safe For Work) content of any kind, including bots or AI generators that can produce, distribute, or facilitate access to NSFW content.
    -   Inflammatory religious commentary or inaccurate or misleading quotations of religious texts.
    -   False information and features, including inaccurate device data or trick/joke functionality, such as fake location trackers.
    -   Harmful concepts which capitalize or seek to profit on recent or current events, such as violent conflicts, terrorist attacks, and epidemics.
    -   Impersonating TFH or Worldcoin.
-   **Physical Harm**
    -   If your app behaves in a way that risks physical harm, we may reject it.
    -   Apps that encourage consumption of tobacco and vape products, illegal drugs, or excessive amounts of alcohol are not permitted.

## Naming

Apps must comply with the below naming and description guidelines.

-   **App naming:**
    -   Keep names short and memorable for optimal recall and display.
    -   Don't use "World" in the name.
    -   Don't use descriptions as Mini App names.
    -   Don't use generic functional terms like "Earn", "Swap", etc. as your Mini App name.
    -   Don't try to mimic the name of a popular app, as this can lead to confusion. Apps may be rejected or penalized if their names mimic popular brands by simply swapping numbers or case.
    -   Do not include trademarked words, names of other apps, or explicit content.
    -   Exclude the use of special characters, or emojis.
    -   Ensure the name works well in your primary languages, and isn't offensive in other major markets.
-   **App description:**
    -   Use plain, approachable language that clearly explains what the Mini App does.
    -   Describe the benefit or purpose in a straightforward way.
    -   Avoid spammy or misleading descriptions.
    -   Keep the tone aligned with World's voice: simple, human, and trustworthy. Avoid exaggerated, tech-heavy, or overly promotional phrasing.
    -   Write descriptions that are respectful, globally understandable, and free from language that might be offensive in other regions.
    -   Don't list functionality like "Earn", "Swap", or "Send" as standalone descriptions. Instead, explain how the app helps the user in their everyday life.
    -   Aim for one or two short sentences (under 25 words total) that communicate the app's value quickly. Users should understand the purpose at a glance e.g. Join real local meetups. No accounts, no spam, just one human per invite.

## Legal

Apps must comply with all legal requirements to be listed within World App. This includes the following:

-   **Privacy:**
    -   **Consent**: All apps that collect and store data from the user must request access and gain approval from the user before doing so
    -   **Data Minimization:** Apps should only request access to data that is relevant to how the app functions
-   **Regulatory Compliance:** The application itself is responsible for maintaining regulatory compliance in all jurisdictions where it selects to be shown to users. Although the burden of compliance rests on the submitted application, if TFH determines that an application is non-compliant with jurisdiction(s) it has a right to take down the application and ask for it to be re-submitted in jurisdictions where it is compliant

## App Submission

Applications must be submitted for review on the developer platform. Before submission, please ensure the following:

-   Test your app for bugs
-   Ensure that your app contains a live integration with a Worldcoin SDK, either IDkit or MiniKit
-   Ensure that all app information in your dev portal submission is complete and accurate
-   Ensure your contact information is updated so the review team can contact you
-   Ensure your app can be accessed by the review team for testing
-   Ensure your app complies with laws and regulations in the jurisdictions where it is shown to users.
-   Check whether your app follows the <Link href="/mini-apps/guidelines/app-guidelines">design guidelines</Link>
-   Check whether your app follows the <Link href="/mini-apps/guidelines/smart-contract-development-guidelines">smart contract development guidelines</Link> (if applicable)
-   Check whether your app follows the <Link href="/mini-apps/guidelines/features-and-guidelines">notification guidelines</Link> (if applicable)

Ensure your app does not violate any of these guidelines, otherwise your app will be rejected.

## App Review

The review team has sole discretion of approving applications for Mini Apps.

Apps will be reviewed as quickly as possible, though if the app is complex or difficult to test it may take some time. You will receive an email if the review status of your app changes, and you can view updates in the developer portal as well.

Tools for Humanity will approve all submitted apps if it deems the following are true:

-   The data submitted in the form is complete and accurate
-   The app is complete and contains all necessary copy and functionality to fulfil itâ€™s purpose outlined in the submission
-   The app is a final version, and is not a demo, trial or beta version
-   The app contains a live integration with IDkit or MiniKit that functioned properly when tested
-   The app abides by the safety and legal guidelines

The review team will provide a rationale for any rejections, to which the developer can re-submit after remediating any concerns. If the application continuously fails review for the same reason, it may take longer for subsequent reviews to occur.

Additionally, World App provides users the ability to report apps. If an app is in violation of the safety and legal guidelines or the review team deems the app should be removed for other reasons, the team has the sole discretion to remove an app from the platform. If an app is removed from the platform or an investigation is in progress, the development team will be alerted.

## Technical Requirements

-   On Android and iOS, the World App Mini App should support operation under poor internet connections and handle temporary disconnections properly.
-   The World App Mini App must be reliable, with no infinite loading during non-standard user actions.
-   The World App Mini App must comply with the rules of both the Android and iOS app stores.
-   The World App Mini App must not contain features that are unavailable on certain platforms.
-   User progress must synchronize seamlessly between different platform versions.

## User Support
