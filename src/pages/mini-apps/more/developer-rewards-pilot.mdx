# Developer Rewards Pilot

To further support builders, World is also piloting a new Developer Rewards program, this began on April 1, 2025.
The program rewards qualifying developers on a monthly basis based on how many verified humans use and benefit from their Mini Apps and additional criteria.
The initial three month pilot seeks to distribute the equivalent of $300K USD in Developer Rewards, paid in WLD, with the potential for extension based on the program's success.
This initiative aims to reward developers who push the boundaries of Mini Apps and introduce innovative use cases for both World ID and the World App wallet.
