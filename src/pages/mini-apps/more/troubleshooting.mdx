# Troubleshooting

If you're having trouble with your mini-app, here are some common issues and solutions.

### **Triggering a command on initialize**

**Problem:** Since we use a client side component to install the minikit provider onto the `Window` object.
If you try to trigger a command seperately as soon as the page opens via a separate `useEffect` hook
it can result in a race condition where minikit is not yet installed when you call the command.

**Fix:** If you wish to call a command on open include the command inside the same `useEffect` hook you use to install MiniKit.

```tsx {{ title: '/components/MiniKitProvider.tsx' }}
'use client'

import { useEffect, ReactNode } from 'react'
import { MiniKit } from '@worldcoin/minikit-js'

export const MiniKitProvider = ({ children }: { children: ReactNode }) => {
	useEffect(() => {
		MiniKit.install()

		// Add any commands you wish to trigger on start here to prevent race conditions
		MiniKit.commands.walletAuth({
			// ...
		})
	}, [])

	return <>{children}</>
}
```
