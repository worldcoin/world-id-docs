# Webview Specifications

The widget is opened within the World App via a WebView. This means providers can tailor their solutions by considering the specific features and restrictions of these platforms.

### **Capabilities:**

- **WebView Engine:**
    - **Android:** Uses Android's native WebView implementation.
    - **iOS:** Uses **WKWebView**, the recommended web rendering engine on iOS, offering enhanced security and performance.
- **File System and Camera Access:**
    - Access to the camera and file system (e.g., for file uploads) is possible if the user grants permission.
- **Cookies and DOM Storage:**
    - Supported on both platforms with explicit activation for Android and default behavior for iOS.
- **Location:**
    - Location is supported on both platforms.
    ```javascript
    navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition((position) => {
        console.log(position);
    });
    ```

### **Restrictions:**
