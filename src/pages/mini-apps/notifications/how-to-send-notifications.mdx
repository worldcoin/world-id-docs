# Send Notifications

First of all, please take a minute to read the [Features & Guidelines](/mini-apps/notifications/features-and-guidelines).
It's important to follow these, otherwise we may block your ability to send notifications.

To send notifications to users you need to:

-   Request permission in the Dev Portal Advanced settings, for your mini app,
-   request permission to send notifications from the user, via minikit (see [Request Permission](/mini-apps/commands/request-permission)),
-   actually send the notification using our API or the Developer Portal (see [How To Send Notifications](/mini-apps/notifications/how-to-send-notifications)).

Notifications are queued on our servers, users may not receive them immediately.

## Manually sending notifications from Developer Portal

You can send notifications to multiple wallet addresses (up to a thousand) directly from the Developer Portal.

![Notification Interface in the Developer Portal](/images/docs/mini-apps/commands/notifications-dev-portal.png)

Use the form to input addresses, and content details. Once you click the `Send` button and get a success response, your notifications will be queued for delivery.

## Calling the send-notification endpoint

You can also call our API to send notifications. For detailed information, see the [API Reference](/mini-apps/reference/api#send-notification).

## Testing

We currently have a limit of 40 notifications per 4 hours for unverified apps. This is to help you test your notification implementations.
Currently you will need to create a new app if your app is verified as it will default to the verified app's metadata. In addition, you need
to enable notifications for your mini app inside of World App to receive them.
