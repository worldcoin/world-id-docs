# Address Book

The Address Book is a contract that stores verified World ID addresses. You can check if a user's address and associated ENS name (if available) is Orb verified using the `getIsUserVerified` helper function.

## Considerations

- Default RPC is `https://worldchain-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/public`
- Contract Address is [0x57b930D551e677CC36e2fA036Ae2fe8FdaE0330D](https://worldscan.org/address/0x57b930D551e677CC36e2fA036Ae2fe8FdaE0330D#readContract).

## Implementation

The helper function connects to the World Chain and checks if a given wallet address is verified by querying the Address Book contract.

## Example Usage
```typescript
import { getIsUserVerified } from "@worldcoin/minikit-js"

const userWalletAddress = "0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dEaD"
const isUserVerified = await getIsUserVerified(userWalletAddress) // optionally you can provide your rpc url as a second argument to the function
```
- Returns `true` if the address is verified
- Returns `false` if the address is not verified
- Throws an error if the verification check fails


## React Bindings

For React applications, we provide a hook `useIsUserVerified` that handles the verification check and loading state.
