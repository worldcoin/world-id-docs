# Usernames

## Introduction

Usernames are ENS-compatible identifiers for every World App user, ensuring consistency and easy recognition.
For example, when displaying transaction history, show the username instead of the wallet address to make it more user-friendly and private.

The usernames service is public, docs can be found [here](https://usernames.worldcoin.org/docs). This will be mostly useful for more advanced use cases.

## How to get it

To get the user's username you can either complete Wallet Auth and access the username/profile picture url from MiniKit directly:

```tsx
const username = MiniKit.user.username
```

Or you can request it manually, using the `getUserByAddress` method on MiniKit:

```tsx
const worldIdUser = await MiniKit.getUserByAddress(userAddress)
```

Other ways involve querying the [usernames service](https://usernames.worldcoin.org/docs).
