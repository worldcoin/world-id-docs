# Quick Actions

### **What Are Quick Actions?**

A Quick Action is a universal deeplink defined by a schema that navigates to a specific path inside your app.
It facilitates direct integrations between mini apps, enabling one app (App A) to use a feature or action of another app (App B) seamlessly.
In short, you can create a quick action for your own mini app to share it with other developers or use other mini app quick actions that will be listed in this page.

<Note type="info">
	If a user clicks on your link and has World App installed, it will automatically open the mini app inside of World
	App to the specified path. Otherwise, it will direct them to the app store and prompt them to install World App.
</Note>

### **Benefits of Quick Actions**

1. **Leverage Expertise**: Use other mini apps already working specific features.
2. **Resource & Time Optimization**: Focus on your apps core functionalities while outsourcing supplementary features.
3. **Community Growth**: Integrating another apps functionality opens opportunities for co-marketing.
