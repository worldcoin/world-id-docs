# Configuring IDKit

IDKit is a single React component, and we'll be writing two callback functions: `handleVerify` and `onSuccess`.

## IDKitWidget

First, add the `IDKitWidget` component to your site. The values for the `app_id` and `action` props were obtained from the Developer Portal in [Installation](/quick-start/installation). We'll define the `handleVerify` and `onSuccess` callbacks next.

```tsx {{ title: "/verify.tsx"}}
'use client' // for Next.js app router
import { IDKitWidget, VerificationLevel, ISuccessResult } from '@worldcoin/idkit'

// ...

<IDKitWidget
	app_id="your app id" // obtained from the Developer Portal
	action="your action id" // obtained from the Developer Portal
	onSuccess={onSuccess} // callback when the modal is closed
	handleVerify={handleVerify} // callback when the proof is received
	verification_level={VerificationLevel.Orb}
>
	{({ open }) => 
        // This is the button that will open the IDKit modal
        <button onClick={open}>Verify with World ID</button>
    }
</IDKitWidget>
```

## handleVerify

The `handleVerify` callback is called when the user's proof is received. This will send the proof to your backend for verification:

```tsx {{ title: "/verify.tsx"}}
const handleVerify = async (proof: ISuccessResult) => {
    const res = await fetch("/api/verify", { // route to your backend will depend on implementation
        method: "POST",
        headers: {
            "Content-Type": "application/json",
        },
        body: JSON.stringify(proof),
    })
    if (!res.ok) {
        throw new Error("Verification failed."); // IDKit will display the error message to the user in the modal
    }
};
```

## Backend Verification

The `handleVerify` callback sends the proof to your backend for verification. The backend handler should verify the proof with the Developer Portal API:

<Note type="warning">The call to the Developer Portal API must be made from your backend, not from the frontend.</Note>

```tsx {{ title: "/api/verify.ts"}}
const verifyRes = await fetch(`https://developer.worldcoin.org/api/v1/verify/${your_app_id}`, {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({...proof, action: "your action id"}),
})
```

If the verification request to the Developer Portal succeeds, the backend should perform any necessary actions, such as updating a user's status in a database. If the verification request fails, the backend should handle the error and return an appropriate response to the frontend.

```tsx {{ title: "/api/verify.ts"}}
if (verifyRes.ok) {
    // This is where you should perform backend actions if the verification succeeds
    // Such as, setting a user as "verified" in a database
    res.status(verifyRes.status).send({
        code: "success",
        detail: "This action verified correctly!",
    });
} else {
    // This is where you should handle errors from the World ID /verify endpoint. 
    // Usually these errors are due to a user having already verified.
    res
    .status(verifyRes.status)
    .send({ code: wldResponse.code, detail: wldResponse.detail });
}
```

## onSuccess

The `onSuccess` callback is called when the user closes the modal. This is where you can perform any necessary actions, such as redirecting the user to a new page.

```tsx {{ title: "/verify.tsx"}}
const onSuccess = () => {
    // This is where you should perform any actions after the modal is closed
    // Such as redirecting the user to a new page
    window.location.href = "/success";
};
```
