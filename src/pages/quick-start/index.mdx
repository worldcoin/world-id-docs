# Integration guide

This guide will walk you through everything you need to get started with World ID or Sign in with World ID!

1. Sign in to the [Developer Portal](https://developer.worldcoin.org). You will need a World-ID compatible wallet (such as the [World App](https://worldcoin.org/download)) and a Device- or Orb-Verified World ID to sign in.
    <Note>While adding your email is optional, adding it is encouraged. This will allow you to maintain access to your Developer Portal account should you lose your World ID.</Note>

2. Decide whether you're going to use **Sign in with World ID** or **Incognito Actions**. Here's a helpful guide:
    <Tabs> 
        <TabItem label="Sign in with World ID">
        ### Sign in with World ID
        Sign in with World ID is built to bring the privacy benefits of World ID to a broad range of apps as easily as possible. It is a simple, drop-in authentication mechanism that works with any OIDC-compatible authentication engine.
        
        ✅ When to use Sign in with World ID:
        - You want to know that an account belongs to a real person, and each real person only has one account.
        - You already use Auth0, NextAuth, or a similar authentication engine in your app.
        - You want to allow users to preserve their privacy, or even stay completely anonymous.
        
        🚫 When **not** to use Sign in with World ID:
        - Your app has an on-chain component (e.g. a smart contract).
        - You want a user to be able to have multiple accounts and keep them separate.
        - You want to verify a user is doing a specific action only once.
        </TabItem>
        <TabItem label="Incognito Actions">
        ### Incognito Actions
        Incognito Actions are a powerful tool for sybil-resistance both on and off-chain. They allow you to verify a user is doing something only once, for a particular context. For example, you can verify a person is claiming a particular airdrop just once.
        
        ✅ When to use Incognito Actions:
        - You want to verify a user is doing something only once, for a particular context.
        - Your user will be taking multiple discrete actions (e.g. claiming multiple airdrops, voting on multiple proposals, etc.) and you want to allow each action to be done only once.
        - Your app interacts with a smart contract on-chain.
        
        🚫 When **not** to use Incognito Actions:
        - You want to use World ID for authentication or identification of a user. (Use Sign in with World ID instead.)
        </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

3. Create and configure your first app.

	-	Name your app something recognizable. It will be displayed to users when they are asked to Verify with World ID.
	-   Select the environment to use: Staging or Production.
		- Use Staging apps for testing and development. You must use the [Worldcoin Simulator](https://simulator.worldcoin.org) to verify actions.
		- Use Production apps for production. You must use the [World App](https://worldcoin.org/download) to verify actions.
	-   Select whether you want this action to be cloud-based or on-chain. Cloud-based actions are verified with our Cloud API, while on-chain actions are verified by our smart contracts on the blockchain.
        <Note>
            If you want to use **Sign in with World ID**, ensure you select **Cloud-based**.
        </Note>

4. Note your App ID (also called the Client ID). It looks something like {/* cSpell:disable */}`app_GBkZ1KlVUdFTjeMXskrX`{/* cSpell:enable */}. For Sign in with World ID, you should also note your Client Secret, which is found alongside the Client ID in the **Sign In** tab.

5. Follow our guides specific to your use case:
    <Tabs>
        <TabItem label="Sign in with World ID">
            Follow the [Auth0 Integration](https://worldcoin.org/auth0) installation instructions to add Sign in with World ID to your Auth0 Tenant using the Client ID and Client Secret found in the [Developer Portal](https://developer.worldcoin.org).
            <Note>
                If your app hasn't yet integrated Auth0, you can use any of their [various SDK libraries](https://auth0.com/docs/libraries) to get started. This allows using Sign in with World ID on a very broad range of platforms, including web, mobile, and desktop apps.
            </Note>
        </TabItem>
        {/* <TabItem label="NextAuth Template">
            1. Create a new repository from our [World ID NextAuth Template Repository](https://github.com/worldcoin/world-id-nextauth-template).
            2. Rename `.env.example` to `.env.local`, and add your Client ID and Client Secret to the `.env.local` file in your new repository. You can find these in the [Developer Portal](https://developer.worldcoin.org).
            3. Add the app's URL to the list of allowed redirect URIs in the [Developer Portal](https://developer.worldcoin.org). For example, if your app is hosted at `https://example.com`, add `https://example.com/api/auth/callback/worldcoin` to the list of allowed redirect URIs.
            <Note>
                You must use a Staging App to use `localhost` as part of a redirect URI. For this example, you'd use `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/worldcoin` as the redirect URI.
            </Note>
            4. Run `pnpm i && pnpm dev` to install dependencies and run the app locally, or deploy the app to [Vercel](https://vercel.com).
        </TabItem> */}
        <TabItem value="cloud" label="Cloud Incognito Actions">
            <Note>
                If you'd rather not use our template repository, look at the [Cloud Verification documentation](/id/cloud).
            </Note>
            Getting started with our Cloud template is easy:
            - Create an Action for your App in the Developer Portal.
            - Create a new repository based on our [Cloud Verification template](https://github.com/worldcoin/world-id-cloud-template).
            - Rename `.env.example` to `.env.local` and input your App ID and Action.
            - Run `pnpm i && pnpm dev` to install dependencies and start the server.
            - Open http://localhost:3000 in your web browser to see the demo!

            This example app uses [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) to host the app. It sends a request from its backend to our API's [`/verify` endpoint](/reference/api/#verify) to verify the proof returned from IDKit.

            <Note type="warning">
                It's very important that you verify the proof on your backend, not your frontend. Otherwise, users can easily bypass your verification by manipulating state in the frontend.
            </Note>
            
            Modify the [`/src/pages/api/verify.ts`](https://github.com/worldcoin/world-id-cloud-template/blob/main/src/pages/api/verify.ts) file to add code that runs in the backend after a user is verified. For example, you can add code to mark a user as verified in a database, or to send a user a reward.

            Modify the onSuccess function in [`/src/pages/index.tsx`](https://github.com/worldcoin/world-id-cloud-template/blob/main/src/pages/index.tsx) to add code that runs in the frontend after a user is verified. For example, you can add code to show a success message to the user.
        </TabItem>
        <TabItem value="on-chain" label="On-Chain Incognito Actions">
            <Note>
                If you'd rather not use our template repository, look at the [On-Chain Verification documentation](/id/on-chain).
            </Note>
            Getting started with our On-Chain template is easy:
            - Create an Action for your On-Chain App in the Developer Portal.
            - Create a new repository based on our [On-Chain Verification template](https://github.com/worldcoin/world-id-onchain-template).
            - Configure the frontend (found in the `src` folder) with your `appId` and `action` from the Developer Portal.
            - Deploy your contract to [one of our testnets](/reference/address-book) and update the `contractAddress` and available chain(s) in the frontend.
            - Run `pnpm i && pnpm dev` to install dependencies and start the web interface.
        </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

6. Test your integration with the [Worldcoin Simulator](https://simulator.worldcoin.org) and a Staging App ID.

    - You can use the Simulator as a web app on either desktop or mobile.
    - Select which identity to use in the Simulator. All identities are already Device- and Orb-verified, and you can choose which credentials to use after scanning the QR code.
        - You can always change identities by tapping the identity icon in the top-left of the simulator.
        - Add more identities by tapping the "+" in the bottom-right.
        - Only Orb credentials are supported on-chain.
    - To begin the World ID verification, tap "Scan QR or Paste data."
        - On mobile, you can scan the QR code with the camera, just as you would in World App.
        - On desktop, you can click the QR code in IDKit to copy the data, then click "Manual Input" to paste the data from the QR code into the Simulator.
    - Select which credential(s) to use for this verification. If multiple credentials are selected, the highest-strength credential will be used.
    - Tap "Verify with World ID" to complete the verification!
