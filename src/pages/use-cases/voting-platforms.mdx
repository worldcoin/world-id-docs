## What?

Using World ID, and particularly relying on global proof of personhood, can be used to build a truly democratic, one person one vote, system as well as novel voting systems centered around unique humans. What’s more, with World ID, these systems can be made in a fully privacy-preserving way, supporting fully anonymous voting, and making sure votes cannot be tracked across different proposals.

## Applications & Problems Solved

### Novel DAOs

(Decentralized Autonomous Organizations) governance. Have governance proposals where individual’s voices are more important than the number of tokens held.

### Anonymous online polls

This can apply for anything from city council elections, governors to referendums, plebiscites, and much more.

### Government

Public elections without duplicate votes, where each voter can only vote once. Further, this can be done in a public way where anyone can verify each election vote. This can apply for anything from city council elections, governors to referendums, plebiscites, and much more.

## The MVP

The most basic version of a voting platform could look something like this.

Users can create proposals to vote on. They provide a description on the proposal and a time limit. Proposals support yes/no/abstain.

Voters can then go into a proposal and cast a vote only once. The vote is verified with a World ID anonymous action (to ensure proof of personhood, uniqueness, and prevent cross-proposals tracking).

Votes are recorded in a backend, smart contract or decentralized database (like Ceramic).

Anyone can view the vote results.

The above can also be further extended to support multiple-option votes, combine with eligibility criteria (e.g. only users with a Twitter account can vote), support multiple World ID credentials for votes where the credential type determines the weight (e.g. Orb credential = 1 vote, phone credential = 0.1 vote).

## More feature ideas

Quadratic voting. Allow only one person, one vote, but votes are counted quadratically, […]

Conviction voting. Consider for example public goods funding, where funds are allocated based on votes received continuously over time. [This article](https://medium.com/giveth/conviction-voting-a-novel-continuous-decision-making-alternative-to-governance-aa746cfb9475) explains more on conviction voting.

Anonymous proof-of-vote NFT. You get an NFT that you can use to prove you voted in a certain proposal. Could be done with [Sismo](https://docs.sismo.io/sismo-docs/technical-documentation/zk-badge-protocol) to preserve privacy.
