# Deploy a sample contract on World Chain

In this tutorial, we will use the [Solidity programming language](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.28/) to write the `HelloWorldChain` smart contract for World Chain.
Solidity is a programming language that can compile to EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) bytecode which can be executed on the World Chain EVM.
We will also be using the [Foundry CLI](https://book.getfoundry.sh/) toolkit, which has a lot of tools to help build, test and interact with Solidity programs. 

## Download development tools

First, we need to install the Foundry CLI toolkit and the Solidity compiler. Solidity comes with a compiler called `solc` which we will use to compile the `HelloWorldChain` contract. The Foundry CLI
will automatically download the right version of the Solidity compiler for you during the compilation process using `forge build`.


```bash {{title: "Install Foundry"}}
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

## Create a Foundry project

Open your terminal of choice, navigate to a directory where you want to create your project, and run the following command to create a new Foundry project:

```bash {{title: "Create a new Foundry project"}}
forge init hello-world-chain && cd hello-world-chain
```

Now that you have created a new Foundry project, you can start writing your smart contract. All smart contracts in Foundry projects are stored in the `src` directory.
If you are using VSCode, it should something look like this:

## Write the HelloWorldChain contract

You can delete the template file called `Counter.sol` in the `/src` directory, create a new file called `HelloWorldChain.sol` and add the following code to it:

```solidity {{title: "HelloWorldChain.sol"}}
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.28;

contract HelloWorldChain {
    string private word;

    // Constructor that sets the initial word to "Hello World Chain!"
    constructor() {
        word = "Hello World Chain!";
    }

    // Setter function to update the word
    function setWord(string memory newWord) public {
        word = newWord;
    }

    // Getter function to return the current word
    function getWord() public view returns (string memory) {
        return word;
    }
}
```

This contract has a `word` variable that stores a string and two functions: `setWord` to update the word and `getWord` to return the current word.

## Compile the contract

To compile the `HelloWorldChain` contract, run the following command:

```bash {{title: "Compile the contract"}}
forge build
```

The `forge build` command will compile the contract using the Solidity compiler and generate the necessary artifacts in the `artifacts` directory.

## Generate a wallet

To deploy the `HelloWorldChain` contract to World Chain Sepolia, you will need a wallet with some World Chain Sepolia ETH. An easy way to generate a 
wallet using the Foundry CLI is to run the following command:

```bash {{title: "Generate a wallet"}}
cast wallet new
```

`cast` is a versatile set of utility functions and commands for Solidity development. In this case, we are using one of its many built-in features to generate a wallet with one account.

<Note>Never share your private key with anyone and always make sure that you don't upload them to code versioning tools like Git and hosting platforms like GitHub.
Research best practices for private key management in order to avoid loss of funds.</Note>

The output of the command will look something like this:
```
Successfully created new keypair.
Address:     0xB815A0c4bC23930119324d4359dB65e27A846A2d
Private key: 0xcc1b30a6af68ea9a9917f1dda20c927704c5cdb2bbe0076901a8a0e40bf997c5
```

## Fund your wallet

Now that you have a wallet, you need to fund it with some World Chain Sepolia ETH. You can get some World Chain Sepolia ETH from the [World Chain Sepolia faucet](https://www.alchemy.com/faucets/world-chain-sepolia) operated by Alchemy.
In the form on the faucet page, enter the address of your wallet which you generated above and click the "Send me ETH" button. If you have any issues please send us a message in the developer 
group chat on [Telegram](https://t.me/worldcoindevelopers) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/worldcoin).


## Deploy the contract

Now that you have a wallet and you funded it with World Chain Sepolia ETH, you can deploy the `HelloWorldChain` contract to World Chain Sepolia using the following `forge create` command:

```bash {{title: "Deploy the contract"}}
forge create src/HelloWorldChain.sol:HelloWorldChain --rpc-url https://worldchain-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/public --private-key 0xcc1b30a6af68ea9a9917f1dda20c927704c5cdb2bbe0076901a8a0e40bf997c5
```

Here, we are using the `<path>:<contractname>` format to specify the contract. This tells Foundry where to find the contract file (src/HelloWorldChain.sol) and which contract within the file (HelloWorldChain) to deploy.
We also use the `--rpc-url` flag to specify the RPC URL of the World Chain Sepolia network and the `--private-key` flag to specify the private key of the wallet we generated earlier. 
On top of this we can also provide other flags like `-vvvvv` to get more verbose output from the deployment process, `--verify` to verify the contract on [Worldscan](https://worldscan.org) or [Blockscout](https://worldchain-sepolia.explorer.alchemy.com/) (alongside with an `--etherscan-api-key` flag) and 
several other flags to toggle different features that you can find more about in the [Foundry documentation](https://book.getfoundry.sh/).

And that's it! You have successfully deployed a smart contract to World Chain Sepolia. You can interact with the contract using `forge script` scripts, using a block explorer or any other EVM library like [ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/), [alloy-rs](https://github.com/alloy-rs/alloy/), and many others.
