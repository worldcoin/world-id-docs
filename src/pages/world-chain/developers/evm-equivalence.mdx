# EVM Equivalence

World Chain is EVM-equivalent because it utilizes the [OP Stack](https://docs.optimism.io/stack/getting-started), a modular framework developed by Optimism,
which ensures compatibility with the [Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/evm/). By leveraging the OP Stack,
World Chain can execute smart contracts and interact with decentralized applications designed for Ethereum
without any modifications. This equivalency enables seamless interoperability with Ethereum's ecosystem of applications and protocols. 
The OP Stack's modularity also allows World Chain to implement scaling solutions and other customizations while maintaining the fundamental EVM equivalence,
ensuring a flexible yet consistent environment for developers and users alike.

## Differences between World Chain, OP Mainnet and Ethereum

Though the EVM remains unchanged across OP Stack (Superchain) chains compared to the Ethereum layer 1, there are some configurations of the execution clients that
do differ.
