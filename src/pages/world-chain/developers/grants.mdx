# Apply for a grant to build on World Chain


The [Worldcoin Foundation](https://worldcoin.foundation) runs the [Human Collective Grants](https://world.org/community-grants) program
which gives grants to builders that help accelerate the [Worldcoin Tech Tree](https://world.org/tech-tree) and [related RFPs](https://world.org/rfp).
The grants program switched from a quarterly waves format to a continuous format where builders can apply for a grant at any point in time. For more information
you can read the [Continuous Grants program announcement blogpost](https://world.org/blog/announcements/worldcoin-foundation-introduces-new-continuous-grants-program-spur-innovation).

## Areas of interest for applications

- Rustification of the [OP Stack](https://docs.optimism.io/stack/getting-started)
- Futhering [the gigagas roadmap](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.paradigm.xyz/2024/04/reth-perf&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1726507097184499&usg=AOvVaw34fUyrLcoigheJlrfbIDM2)
- ZK-ifying the OP Stack (efforts like [OP Succinct](https://blog.succinct.xyz/op-succinct/), [Zeth from Risc0](https://risczero.com/blog/zeth-release) and [Mina's ZK fault proof RFP]())
- Scalability research and engineering (can be Ethereum core as well)
- Embedding priority blockspace for humans into the OP Stack derivation pipeline + fault proof program (open R&D)
- Separate eip1559 fee market for humans on OP Stack
- L2 Execution client development (especially [reth](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth)) and benchmarking
- Improving UX and interoperability
- Chain-level experiments with digital identity and the OP Stack (things like [human priority blockspace](/world-chain/quick-start/features#priority-blockspace-for-humans) and [free gas allowances](/world-chain/quick-start/features#gas-allowance-for-humans) for unique humans)
- Interesting applications on World Chain (past examples include proof aggregators like [Nebra](https://nebra.one/), storage proofs like [Herodotus](https://herodotus.dev/) and [Axiom](https://www.axiom.xyz/), Passkeys module for Safe, and others)
- and more...
