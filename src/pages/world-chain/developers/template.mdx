# Deploy a World ID template app

In this tutorial we are going to deploy a [World ID template app](https://github.com/worldcoin/world-id-onchain-template) on a World Chain Sepolia local fork using anvil.
This app will be a simple web application that allows users to create a World ID proof of personhood and verify it.
The app will be deployed on World Chain Sepolia and will interact with the `WorldIDRouter` smart contract
to verify the ZK proofs of personhood.

## Prerequisites

Before we start, make sure you have the following tools installed:

-   [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (usually pre-installed on most systems)
-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
-   [pnpm](https://yarnpkg.com/) (or equivalent like npm, yarn or bun)
-   [Foundry CLI](https://book.getfoundry.sh/)

## Clone template

First, clone the World ID template app repository from GitHub:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/worldcoin/world-id-onchain-template.git && cd world-id-onchain-template
```

## Install dependencies

Next, install the dependencies for the World ID template app:

```bash
pnpm install
```

## Build the smart contracts

Next we are going to compile the smart contracts for the World ID template app:

```bash
cd contracts && forge build
```

## Understanding World ID

Before we deploy the World ID template app, let's take a look at the smart contracts that are part of the app:

```solidity {{title: "contracts/src/Contract.sol"}}
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.13;

import { ByteHasher } from './helpers/ByteHasher.sol';
import { IWorldID } from './interfaces/IWorldID.sol';

contract Contract {
	using ByteHasher for bytes;

	mapping(uint256 => bool) internal nullifierHashes;

	/// @param nullifierHash The nullifier hash for the verified proof

	event Verified(uint256 nullifierHash);

	/// @param _worldId The WorldID router that will verify the proofs

		worldId = _worldId;
		externalNullifier = abi.encodePacked(abi.encodePacked(_appId).hashToField(), _actionId).hashToField();
	}

	/// @param signal An arbitrary input from the user, usually the user's wallet address (check README for further details)

	/// @dev Feel free to rename this method however you want! We've used `claim`, `verify` or `execute` in the past.
	function verifyAndExecute(address signal, uint256 root, uint256 nullifierHash, uint256[8] calldata proof) public {
		// First, we make sure this person hasn't done this before
		if (nullifierHashes[nullifierHash]) revert DuplicateNullifier(nullifierHash);

		// We now verify the provided proof is valid and the user is verified by World ID
		worldId.verifyProof(
			root,
			groupId,
			abi.encodePacked(signal).hashToField(),
			nullifierHash,
			externalNullifier,
			proof
		);

		// We now record the user has done this, so they can't do it again (proof of uniqueness)
		nullifierHashes[nullifierHash] = true;

		// Finally, execute your logic here, for example issue a token, NFT, etc...
		// Make sure to emit some kind of event afterwards!

		emit Verified(nullifierHash);
	}
}
```

This contract has all the necessary pieces that any app that wants to integrate World ID proofs of personhood will require.
The World ID docs have a [detailed explanation](https://docs.worldcoin.org/world-id) of how the World ID system works and how to integrate it into your app.
But we will go over the main parts of the contract here:

1. The `Contract` contract is the main contract that will be deployed to World Chain Sepolia. It has a constructor that
   takes the `IWorldID` interface, the app ID and the action ID as parameters. The `IWorldID` interface is the World ID router
   that will verify the proofs, the app ID is the ID of the app can be created by the developer using the
   [World ID Developer Portal](https://developer.worldcoin.org/login) and and the action ID is the ID of the action that the user
   is performing which will be generated automatically by the [IDKit SDK](https://docs.worldcoin.org/reference/idkit) and derived
   from `action` string defined in the Developer Portal.
2. The [`nullifierHashes` mapping](https://docs.worldcoin.org/reference/contracts#sybil-resistance) is used to keep track of
   the nullifier hashes that have been used already. This is used to guarantee that an action is only performed once by a single
   person in order to achieve sybil resistance.
3. The `verifyAndExecute` function is the main function that will be called by the user to verify their proof of personhood.
   It takes the user's wallet address, the root of the Merkle tree, the nullifier hash, and the proof as parameters.
4. The function first checks if the nullifier hash has been used already and reverts if it has.
5. It then verifies the proof using the `worldId.verifyProof` function which is part of the `IWorldID` interface.
6. If the proof is valid, the function records the nullifier hash and executes the logic of the app. In this case, it emits
   the `Verified` event.

If you want an example of a production application which uses the World ID protocol, you can check out the
[Worldcoin grants contracts](https://github.com/worldcoin/worldcoin-grants-contracts).
Specifically, the [`RecurringGrantDrop.sol`](https://github.com/worldcoin/worldcoin-grants-contracts/blob/main/src/RecurringGrantDrop.sol)
contract which uses the World ID protocol to verify that the user is a unique human before they can claim a grant.

## Deploy template app

First, you have to go to a node provider that supports World Chain Sepolia. You can use [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/)
or any of the other providers listed in the [World Chain documentation](/world-chain/providers/nodes). Once you have a node provider
account, you need to get an RPC URL for the World Chain Sepolia network. For a simple deployment, the public RPC URL is sufficient.
However, for doing a fork deployment, you will need to run a local fork of World Chain Sepolia using anvil which requires higher
requirements on the RPC provider for forking the network.

First, we will fork the World Chain Sepolia network using anvil:

```bash
# Substitute the RPC_URL with the RPC URL of the World Chain Sepolia network
anvil -f $RPC_URL
```

We need to also set three important environment variables that are required for the deployment of the World ID template app:

-   `WORLD_ID_ROUTER`: The address of the World ID router contract that will verify the proofs (can be found in the [World ID documentation](https://docs.worldcoin.org/world-chain/reference/useful-contracts))
-   `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ID`: The app ID that was generated in the [Developer Portal](https://developer.worldcoin.org/login)
-   `NEXT_PUBLIC_ACTION`: The action ID as configured in the [Developer Portal](https://developer.worldcoin.org/login)

Once the fork is running, you can deploy the World ID template app to the World Chain Sepolia network using the Foundry CLI:

```bash
# cd into the contracts directory
cd contracts
forge create --rpc-url http://localhost:8545 --private-key 0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80 src/Contract.sol:Contract --constructor-args $WORLD_ID_ROUTER $NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ID $NEXT_PUBLIC_ACTION
```

This command will deploy the `Contract` contract to the World Chain Sepolia network using the provided RPC URL and private key.

## Local Web Setup

Set up your environment variables in the `.env` file. You will need to set the following variables:

-   `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ID`: The app ID as configured in the [Worldcoin Developer Portal](https://developer.worldcoin.org).
-   `NEXT_PUBLIC_ACTION`: The action ID as configured in the Worldcoin Developer Portal.
-   `NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_ID`: Your WalletConnect ID.
-   `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS`: The address of the contract deployed in the previous step.

Back in the root directory of the World ID template app, you can start the local web server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

The Contract ABI will be automatically re-generated and saved to `src/abi/ContractAbi.json` on each run of `pnpm dev`.

## Iterating

After making changes to the contract, you should:

-   re-run the `forge create` command from above
-   replace the `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` environment variable with the new contract address
-   if your contract ABI has changed, restart the local web server

## Testing

You'll need to import the private keys on the local testnet into your wallet used for local development. The default development seed phrase is `test test test test test test test test test test test junk`.

<Note> This is only for local development. Do not use this seed phrase on mainnet or any public testnet. </Note>

When connecting your wallet to the local development environment, you will be prompted to add the network to your wallet.

Use the [Worldcoin Simulator](https://simulator.worldcoin.org) in place of World App to scan the IDKit QR codes and generate the zero-knowledge proofs.
