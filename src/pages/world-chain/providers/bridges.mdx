# Superchain Bridges

The Superchain bridge is the native bridge for World Chain as it comes with the OP Stack smart contracts which power the network. There are several interface providers for this bridge and it allows users to bridge assets from Ethereum mainnet and onto World Chain and vice versa.

## Superbridge Core

[Superbridge.app](https://superbridge.app/world-chain) is a blockchain bridging platform that enables users to transfer Ethereum (ETH) and ERC20 tokens between different blockchain networks, primarily focusing on OP Stack Layer 2 rollups chains including the World Chain network.

## Alchemy Bridge

The [native bridge interface for World Chain mainnet](https://worldchain-mainnet.bridge.alchemy.com/) provided by [Alchemy](https://alchemy.com/) is the rollup as a service (RaaS) provider for World Chain. As part of this service it also provides a World Chain bridge interface for users to deposit to and withdraw assets from the network. There is also a [testnet bridge](https://worldchain-sepolia.bridge.alchemy.com/) available for developers and users to bridge assets to the World Chain Sepolia testnet.

# Third-party bridges

<Note>
	Across is the recommended provider for bridging WLD between World Chain and other networks.
</Note>

## Across

[Across](https://app.across.to/bridge?) is an intent-based cross-chain bridging protocol that allows users to transfer tokens between different blockchain networks, particularly focusing on Layer 2 solutions and Ethereum-compatible chains.

## Brid.gg

[Brid.gg](https://brid.gg/) facilitates cross-chain transactions and aims to improve interoperability between different blockchain networks. It primarily connects Ethereum Mainnet to OP Chains including World Chain, allowing for transfers of digital assets across various blockchains.

## Superbridge fast

[Superbridge Fast](https://superbridge.app/fast) is a service offered by Superbridge that allows users to deposit and withdraw assets to and from World Chain quickly using third party bridges like [Synapse](/world-chain/providers/bridges#synapse), [Across](/world-chain/providers/bridges#across), and [Hyperlane](/world-chain/providers/bridges#hyperlane) which are directly integrated with the Superchain bridge interface. This is the fastest way to bridge assets to and from World Chain.
The next best method is to use the native Superchain bridge for which both Alchemy and Superbridge Core provide interfaces.

## Synapse

[Synapse](https://synapseprotocol.com/) is a cross-chain communication protocol that enables seamless asset transfers and messaging across different blockchain networks. It provides a secure and efficient infrastructure for interoperability, allowing users to move tokens and data between various chains without the need for centralized intermediaries.

## Hyperlane

[Hyperlane](https://hyperlane.xyz/) is an innovative interoperability protocol designed to facilitate seamless cross-chain communication and enable the development of interchain applications.

Hyperlane provides permissionless infrastructure for sending arbitrary data between blockchains, allowing developers to create applications that can be accessed from any connected chain.
It supports general asset transfers and custom cross-chain messaging, enabling users to interact with assets and applications across different networks including World Chain.

## LayerZero

[LayerZero](https://layerzero.network/) is an omnichain interoperability protocol that enables seamless communication between different blockchains.

## Chainlink CCIP

[Chainlink CCIP](https://chain.link/cross-chain) is a blockchain interoperability protocol that enables developers to build secure applications that can transfer tokens, messages (data), or both tokens and messages across chains.
You can see World Chain-specific documentation for CCIP [here](https://docs.chain.link/ccip/directory/mainnet/chain/ethereum-mainnet-worldchain-1).

## Thirdweb Universal Bridge

Thirdweb's [Universal Bridge](https://portal.thirdweb.com/connect/pay/overview) is a comprehensive Web3 payment solution that allows your users to onramp, bridge, and swap on any EVM chain — with any EVM token or fiat — thanks to its automatic cross-chain routing.

# Liquidity Layers

## Cortex Protocol

[Cortex Protocol](https://cortexprotocol.com/) is a decentralized, non-custodial liquidity protocol built on Ethereum that enables users to lend and borrow crypto assets. The protocol is designed to provide a secure and efficient platform for decentralized finance (DeFi) activities.
