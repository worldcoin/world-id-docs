# Paymasters

## Alchemy

[Alchemy Paymasters](https://www.alchemy.com/overviews/what-is-a-paymaster) are smart contracts that enable decentralized applications (dApps) to implement flexible gas policies, including: 
- Sponsoring gas fees for users
- Accepting gas payments in ERC-20 tokens instead of native blockchain currency

## Pimlico

[Pimlico](https://pimlico.io/) provides account abstraction infrastructure including [paymasters](https://docs.pimlico.io/infra/paymaster) and [bundlers](https://docs.pimlico.io/infra/bundler). They offer two types of paymasters to abstract away gas fees for users in the ERC-4337 ecosystem.
A verifying paymaster allows developers to sponsor on-chain gas fees for users, it utilizes an off-chain Pimlico balance loaded through a dashboard and an ERC-20 paymaster which is a permissionless on-chain smart contract that enables users to pay gas fees using their ERC-20 tokens and operates without requiring developer intervention.

Pimlico's paymasters can be seamlessly integrated with [permissionless.js](https://docs.pimlico.io/permissionless), a TypeScript library built on [viem](https://github.com/wevm/viem/) for ERC-4337 development.
