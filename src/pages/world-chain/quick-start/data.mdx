# World Chain data dashboards

Worldcoin has partnered with several [data providers](/world-chain/providers/data) which have indexed World Chain data and serve it to
developers and data analysts through their APIs. As part of our ongoing efforts for transparency and accountability through open-sourcing
our technologies like the orb hardware, orb firmware, biometrics pipeline, World ID protocol and most other components of the Worldcoin ecosystem,
we believe that having open-source data and dashboards that showcase the progress of the Worldcoin project is essential. 

You can find all of the main dashboards that track World Chain, World App and Worldcoin metrics in the [World Dune dashboard](https://dune.com/world/world). 
If you want to see Dune dashboards that are specific to World Chain, check out [this Dune page](https://dune.com/blockchains/worldchain). 

Another very important dashboard is the [L2BEAT World Chain dashboard](https://l2beat.com/scaling/projects/world) which shows all the metrics related to the OP Stack which includes a security,
decentralization and scalability assessment, risk analysis table and a TVL dashboard.
