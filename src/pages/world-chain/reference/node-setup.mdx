# How to set up a World Chain node

Follow this guide to set up your own World Chain node.

## Overview

World Chain mainnet and testnet run on the OP Stack as part of the Superchain. We provide a simple Docker Compose configuration for running World Chain nodes, [simple-worldchain-node](https://github.com/worldcoin-foundation/simple-worldchain-node). If you're interested in building a node from source, see the [documentation from Optimism](https://docs.optimism.io/builders/node-operators/tutorials/node-from-souce).

## Using `simple-worldchain-node`

`simple-worldchain-node` supports World Chain Mainnet and Sepolia, full nodes and archive nodes, and two execution clients: [op-geth](https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/op-geth) and [op-reth](https://github.com/paradigmxyz/reth).

### Installation

First, download [`simple-worldchain-node`](https://github.com/worldcoin-foundation/simple-worldchain-node) and create your `.env` file.

```bash {{ title: "Download simple-worldchain-node"}}
git clone https://github.com/worldcoin-foundation/simple-worldchain-node.git
cd simple-worldchain-node
cp .env.example .env
```

Ensure you have installed Docker and Docker Compose by following [this guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#scenario-three-install-the-docker-compose-standalone).

### Configuration

Open your `.env` file in an editor of your choice. The following values must be configured before starting your node.

<Properties>
	<Property name="NETWORK_NAME" type="worldchain-mainnet | worldchain-sepolia" required={true}>
		Used to select which network the node connects to, either `worldchain-mainnet` or `worldchain-sepolia`.
	</Property>
	<Property name="COMPOSE_PROFILES" type="geth | reth" required={true}>
        Used to select your execution client, either `geth` (default) or `reth` (experimental).
	</Property>
	<Property name="GETH_NODE_TYPE" type="full | archive" required={true}>
		When using `op-geth`, determines which type of node to run. Either `full` (less storage, but only recent history) or `archive` (more storage, all history).
	</Property>
	<Property name="L1_RPC_ENDPOINT" type="URL" required={true}>
		An L1 (Ethereum) RPC endpoint. We recommend using [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/) or [QuickNode](https://www.quicknode.com), but any Ethereum RPC provider or archive node will work.
	</Property>
	<Property name="L1_BEACON_RPC_ENDPOINT" type="URL" required={true}>
		An L1 Beacon Archive RPC endpoint. Note that this is not the same as a standard RPC endpoint, as this is used to retrieve Blobs from the Ethereum Beacon Chain. We recommend using [QuickNode](https://www.quicknode.com/).
	</Property>
	<Property name="L1_RPC_TYPE" type="string" required={true}>
		Selects which RPC provider is set in `OP_NODE__RPC_ENDPOINT`. This allows for more efficient syncing given different RPC capabilities. Choose from `alchemy`, `quicknode`, `erigon`, or `basic` for other RPC providers.
	</Property>
</Properties>

For details on optional settings, see the `simple-worldchain-node` [README](https://github.com/worldcoin-foundation/simple-worldchain-node?tab=readme-ov-file#optional-configurations).

### Running your node

To start your node in the background, run the following command from the `simple-worldchain-node` folder:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

To view logs for your node, run the following command:

```bash
docker compose logs -f --tail 10
```

To shut down your node:
```bash
docker compose down
```

### Monitoring your node

A Grafana dashboard is included to monitor your node. Access it by visiting [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and logging in with these credentials:

- Username: `admin`
- Password: `worldchain`

### Upgrading your Node

When new versions of `op-geth`, `op-reth`, or `op-node` are released, we will update the `simple-worldchain-node` repository to use these new versions. You can then update your node to use these versions with the following commands:

```bash
git pull
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d --build
```
