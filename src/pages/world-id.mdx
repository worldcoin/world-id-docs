## Introduction {{ className: 'mt-0 uppercase text-sm text-neutral-400 font-normal', anchor: false }}

World ID is a digital passport that lets a user prove they are a unique and real person while remaining anonymous. This happens through [zero-knowledge proofs](/advanced/zero-knowledge-proofs) (ZKP) and other privacy-preserving cryptographic mechanisms.

You can easily integrate World ID in your app and smart contract or backend. World ID holders can easily and anonymously verify they are a unique human through a compatible identity wallet, like the [World App](https://worldcoin.org/download).

## How it works

In broad strokes, this is how World ID works.

1. User gets their World ID in a compatible wallet (e.g. the [World App](https://worldcoin.org/download)).

2. User receives credentials in their World ID. The flagship credential is biometric verification, currently available by using the [Orb](https://worldcoin.org/blog/engineering/opening-orb-look-inside-worldcoin-biometric-imaging-device). The user can also verify their unique device to obtain the respective credential.

3. Project [integrates with World ID](/quick-start).

4. User connects their World ID to authenticate, and optionally prove they are a unique human doing something only once. The user's wallet will generate a [ZKP](/advanced/zero-knowledge-proofs) to accomplish this.

5. Project verifies the [ZKP](/advanced/zero-knowledge-proofs), either by using the [API](/id/cloud) or by verifying it [on-chain](/id/on-chain).

## Privacy

-   World ID offers the highest standards of privacy. The core protocol relies on [Zero-Knowledge Proofs](/advanced/zero-knowledge-proofs) to ensure that **no one** (including core Worldcoin contributors) can:
    -   Link a user to a specific person (unless they explicitly do so with a third-party app).
    -   Link users across applications, or even across incognito actions.
    -   Know a person's iris code (even if they have verified at an Orb).
-   World ID can be used without providing personal information. No emails, no social profiles, no names, everything is optional.
-   The Protocol is self-custodial by default and users are in full control.
    -   The user's World ID is stored in their device, encrypted, following best practices.
