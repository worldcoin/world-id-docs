# Verifying Proofs On-Chain

World ID proofs can be fully verified on-chain. After all, the source of truth for the decentralized protocol is on-chain. To verify a World ID proof, your smart contract will embed a call to the `verifyProof` method of the World ID contract, and then execute the rest of its logic as usual.

The [smart contract starter kit](https://github.com/worldcoin/world-id-onchain-template) and the [frontend & on-chain monorepo template](https://github.com/worldcoin/world-id-onchain-template) are great resources to help you get started with World ID.
Using one of these repositories is strongly recommended to get started with World ID on-chain.

The following examples demonstrate the most common use case: verifying proofs from only Orb-verified users, for a single action, with a user's wallet address as the signal, while also enabling sybil-resistance.

This setup is recommended for most users, as it is the most gas-efficient. For more information on use cases that require more complex setups (such as multiple actions or other types of signals), see the [Advanced On-Chain Verification](/world-id/id/on-chain) page.

<Note>
	At the core of the World ID Protocol is the use of [Semaphore](https://docs.semaphore.pse.dev/). Semaphore is a
	zk-SNARK based privacy protocol that allows for the creation of anonymous credential systems developed by the
	Ethereum Foundation. Read more about [The Protocol](https://whitepaper.world.org/#world-network-protocol) and
	[Semaphore](https://docs.semaphore.pse.dev/).
</Note>
## IDKit Configuration

When verifying proofs on-chain, there are a few changes you have to make to your IDKit configuration. You must ensure that the app created in the Developer Portal is configured as an on-chain app, and you should only accept Orb credentials in IDKit, as World ID Device is not currently supported on-chain.

```tsx
import { IDKitWidget } from '@worldcoin/idkit'

const { address } = useAddress() // get the user's wallet address

<IDKitWidget
    app_id="app_GBkZ1KlVUdFTjeMXKlVUdFT" // must be an app set to on-chain in Developer Portal
    action="claim_nft"
    signal={address} // proof will only verify if the signal is unchanged, this prevents tampering
    onSuccess={onSuccess} // use onSuccess to call your smart contract
    // no use for handleVerify, so it is removed
    // use default verification_level (orb-only), as device credentials are not supported on-chain
>
    {({ open }) => <button onClick={open}>Verify with World ID</button>}
</IDKitWidget>
```

## Contract Addresses

The World ID Router contract is what you should use to verify proofs. It is deployed on multiple chains, and you can find the addresses for each chain in our contracts [Address Book](/world-id/reference/address-book).

## `hashToField` Helper Function

Our contracts use a custom hash function that returns a `uint256` that is guaranteed to be in the field of the elliptic curve we use. This is necessary to ensure that the `uint256` returned by the hash function can be used in our zero-knowledge proofs.

```solidity
library ByteHasher {
	/// @dev Creates a keccak256 hash of a bytestring.
	/// @param value The bytestring to hash
	/// @return The hash of the specified value
	/// @dev `>> 8` makes sure that the result is included in our field
	function hashToField(bytes memory value) internal pure returns (uint256) {
		return uint256(keccak256(abi.encodePacked(value))) >> 8;
	}
}
```

To use this function, simply import the `ByteHasher` library and call `hashToField` on your bytestring.

```solidity
import { ByteHasher } from './helpers/ByteHasher.sol';

contract HelloWorld {
	using ByteHasher for bytes;
	// {...}
	abi.encodePacked('hello world').hashToField(); // returns the keccak256 hash of 'hello world' as a uint256
	// {...}
```

## Constructor

The `externalNullifier` is the unique identifier of the action performed in Semaphore, and its keccak256 hash (named `externalNullifierHash`) is what is passed to the World ID Router contract. It is a combination of the app ID and the action.
You should typically set it in the constructor to save gas (as is done in this example), as it will not change if all users are performing the same action.

We additionally set the `groupId` to `1`, which limits this example to Orb-verified users only. World ID Device is currently not supported on-chain.

```solidity
/// @dev This allows us to use our hashToField function on bytes
using ByteHasher for bytes;

/// @notice Thrown when attempting to reuse a nullifier
error InvalidNullifier();

/// @dev The address of the World ID Router contract that will be used for verifying proofs
IWorldID internal immutable worldId;

/// @dev The keccak256 hash of the externalNullifier (unique identifier of the action performed), combination of appId and action
uint256 internal immutable externalNullifierHash;

/// @dev The World ID group ID (1 for Orb-verified)
uint256 internal immutable groupId = 1;

/// @dev Whether a nullifier hash has been used already. Used to guarantee an action is only performed once by a single person
mapping(uint256 => bool) internal nullifierHashes;

/// @param _worldId The address of the WorldIDRouter that will verify the proofs
/// @param _appId The World ID App ID (from Developer Portal)
/// @param _actionId The World ID Action (from Developer Portal)
constructor(
    IWorldID _worldId,
    string memory _appId,
    string memory _action
) {
    worldId = _worldId;
    externalNullifierHash = abi
        .encodePacked(abi.encodePacked(_appId).hashToField(), _action)
        .hashToField();
}
```

<Note>On-chain verification will succeed for **7 days** after a proof is created.</Note>

## verifyProof

The `verifyProof` method reverts if the proof is invalid, meaning you can just call it as part of your smart contract's logic and execute the rest of your logic after as usual.

<Note type="warning">
	Note that calling the `verifyProof` function by itself does not provide sybil-resistance, or prevent proof reuse --
	it just verifies that the proof is valid. However, this example **does** implement sybil-resistance by checking that
	the `nullifierHash` has not been verified before.
</Note>

The `verifyProof` method takes the arguments below.

-   `root` - The World ID root to verify against. This is obtained from the IDKit widget, and should be passed as-is.
-   `groupId` - This must be `1` for Orb-verified users. World ID Device is currently not supported on-chain.
-   `signalHash` - The keccak256 hash of the signal to verify.
-   `nullifierHash` - Anonymous user ID for this action. This is obtained from the IDKit widget, and should just be passed as-is.
-   `externalNullifierHash` - The externalNullifierHash, which identifies which app and action the user is verifying for.
-   `proof` - The proof to verify. This is obtained from the IDKit widget.

```solidity
/// @param signal An arbitrary input from the user that cannot be tampered with. In this case, it is the user's wallet address.
/// @param root The root (returned by the IDKit widget).
/// @param nullifierHash The nullifier hash for this proof, preventing double signaling (returned by the IDKit widget).
/// @param proof The zero-knowledge proof that demonstrates the claimer is registered with World ID (returned by the IDKit widget).
function verifyAndExecute(
    address signal,
    uint256 root,
    uint256 nullifierHash,
    uint256[8] calldata proof
) public {
    // First, we make sure this person hasn't done this before
    if (nullifierHashes[nullifierHash]) revert InvalidNullifier();

    // We now verify the provided proof is valid and the user is verified by World ID
    worldId.verifyProof(
        root,
        groupId, // set to "1" in the constructor
        abi.encodePacked(signal).hashToField(),
        nullifierHash,
        externalNullifierHash,
        proof
    );

    // We now record the user has done this, so they can't do it again (sybil-resistance)
    nullifierHashes[nullifierHash] = true;

    // Finally, execute your logic here, knowing the user is verified
}
```

<Note>
 All arguments are of type `uint256`, with the exception of `proof`, which is of type `uint256[8]`. Depending on how you're calling your smart contract, you might be required to unpack it into a `uint256[8]` before passing it to the verifyProof method. To unpack it, use the following code:

<CodeGroup>
```ts {{ title: "viem" }}
import { decodeAbiParameters } from 'viem'

const unpackedProof = decodeAbiParameters([{ type: 'uint256[8]' }], proof)[0]

````

```ts {{ title: "ethers.js" }}
import { defaultAbiCoder as abi } from '@ethers/utils'

const unpackedProof = abi.decode(['uint256[8]'], proof)[0]
````

</CodeGroup>
