# Testing your Integration

To test your integration, we provide the [Worldcoin Simulator](https://simulator.worldcoin.org) to simulate a user using World App in a staging environment.

You can use the simulator from another browser tab and copy the QR code from IDKit with a single click:

<div align="center">
    <video className="m-auto" width="320" height="240" autoPlay muted loop playsInline>
        <source src="/images/docs/introduction/qr-copy.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
        Your browser does not support the video tag.
    </video>
</div>

And then paste the QR code data into the simulator:

<div align="center">
    <video className="m-auto" width="320" height="240" autoPlay muted loop playsInline>
        <source src="/images/docs/introduction/qr-paste.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
        Your browser does not support the video tag.
    </video>
</div>

You should see a successful outcome in IDKit!

<div align="center">
    <video className="m-auto" width="320" height="240" autoPlay muted loop playsInline>
        <source src="/images/docs/introduction/idkit-success.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
        Your browser does not support the video tag.
    </video>
</div>

### Verifying the Proof in the Backend

After receiving the proof from IDKit, it's crucial to verify it on your backend to ensure its authenticity. This step is often overlooked but is essential for security. Make sure to implement the verification logic in your server-side code to validate the proof before proceeding with any user actions.
