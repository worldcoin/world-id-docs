# Integrating on Web (React)

For react integrations, we support 2 paths:

-   [**Widget**](#id-kit-widget): A plug-and-play widget that handles UI/State management for you. Find an example [here](https://github.com/worldcoin/idkit-js/tree/main/examples/with-next)
-   [**Session API**](#session-hook): A react hook that gives you total control of the user journey and UI/State management. Find an example [here](https://github.com/worldcoin/idkit-js/tree/main/examples/with-session).

## Install

<CodeGroup title="Install">

```bash {{ title: "npm" }}
npm i @worldcoin/idkit
```

```bash {{ title: "pnpm" }}
pnpm i @worldcoin/idkit
```

```bash {{ title: "yarn" }}
yarn add @worldcoin/idkit
```

</CodeGroup>

## IDKitWidget

First, add the `IDKitWidget` component to your site. The values for the `app_id` and `action` props were obtained from the Developer Portal in [Getting Started](/world-id/idkit/getting-started). We'll define the `handleVerify` and `onSuccess` callbacks next.

```tsx {{ title: "/verify.tsx"}}
'use client' // for Next.js app router
import { IDKitWidget, VerificationLevel, ISuccessResult } from '@worldcoin/idkit'

// ...
;<IDKitWidget
	app_id="your app id" // obtained from the Developer Portal
	action="your action id" // obtained from the Developer Portal
	onSuccess={onSuccess} // callback when the modal is closed
	handleVerify={handleVerify} // callback when the proof is received
	verification_level={VerificationLevel.Orb}
>
	{({ open }) => (
		// This is the button that will open the IDKit modal
		<button onClick={open}>Verify with World ID</button>
	)}
</IDKitWidget>
```

### handleVerify

The `handleVerify` callback is called when the user's proof is received. This will send the proof to your backend for verification:

```tsx {{ title: "/verify.tsx"}}
const handleVerify = async (proof: ISuccessResult) => {
	const res = await fetch('/api/verify', {
		// route to your backend will depend on implementation
		method: 'POST',
		headers: {
			'Content-Type': 'application/json',
		},
		body: JSON.stringify(proof),
	})
	if (!res.ok) {
		throw new Error('Verification failed.') // IDKit will display the error message to the user in the modal
	}
}
```

### Verifying the proof

The `handleVerify` callback sends the proof to your backend for verification. In the backend handler should verify the proof with the Developer Portal API:

<Note type="warning">
	The call to the Developer Portal API must be made server-side to avoid [man in the middle
	attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack).
</Note>

```tsx {{ title: "/api/verify.ts"}}
import { type IVerifyResponse, verifyCloudProof } from '@worldcoin/idkit-core'

export default async function handler(req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) {
	const proof = req.body
	const app_id = process.env.APP_ID
	const action = process.env.ACTION_ID
	const verifyRes = (await verifyCloudProof(proof, app_id, action)) as IVerifyResponse

	if (verifyRes.success) {
		// This is where you should perform backend actions if the verification succeeds
		// Such as, setting a user as "verified" in a database
		res.status(200).send(verifyRes)
	} else {
		// This is where you should handle errors from the World ID /verify endpoint.
		// Usually these errors are due to a user having already verified.
		res.status(400).send(verifyRes)
	}
}
```

<Note>If you want to verify the proof onchain read more about it [here](./on-chain).</Note>

### onSuccess

The `onSuccess` callback is called when the user closes the modal. This is where you can perform any necessary actions, such as redirecting the user to a new page.

```tsx {{ title: "/verify.tsx"}}
const onSuccess = () => {
	// This is where you should perform any actions after the modal is closed
	// Such as redirecting the user to a new page
	window.location.href = '/success'
}
```

## Session Hook

First, setup the session hook with your configuration:

```tsx {{ title: "/verify.tsx" }}
const { status, sessionURI, result, errorCode } = useSession({
	app_id: 'your app id',
	action: 'your action id',
})
```

After that you need to handle the following possible statuses:

-   **WaitingForConnection**: Display the `sessionURI` to the user eg. with a QR code
-   **Confirmed**: Session ended successfully, now you **must** verify the `result` proof in your backend.
-   **Failed**: Session failed, check `errorCode`
