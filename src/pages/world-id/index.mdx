# How-to

Currently there are two ways of integrating World ID in external applications:

-   **IDKit libraries:** Our lightweight SDKs that make easy verifying users in your applications.
-   **Sign with World ID:** Our [OIDC](https://openid.net/developers/how-connect-works/) wrapper that integrates World ID

## Which should I use?

**Choose IDKit if you:**

-   Want full control over the user interface
-   Need to verify users without page redirects
-   Want the quickest setup

**Choose Sign with World ID if you:**

-   Already use OAuth/OIDC providers (Google, GitHub)
-   Want a standard authentication flow
