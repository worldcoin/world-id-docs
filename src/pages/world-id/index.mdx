# How-to

Currently there are two ways of integrating World ID in external applications:

-   **IDKit libraries:** Our lightweight SDKs that make it easy verifying users in your applications.
-   **Sign with World ID:** Our [OIDC](https://openid.net/developers/how-connect-works/) implementation that integrates World ID into OIDC

## Which should I use?

**Choose IDKit if you:**

-   Want full control over the user interface
-   Need to verify users without page redirects
-   Want the quickest setup
-   Want to uniquely verify your existing users too

**Choose Sign with World ID if you:**

-   Already use OAuth/OIDC providers (Google, GitHub)
-   Want a standard authentication flow

<Note type="info">
	Note: Currently, Sign with World ID creates new user accounts and cannot link to existing accounts. This limitation
	may be addressed in future updates
